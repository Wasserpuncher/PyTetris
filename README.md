# PyTetris


"PyTetris" is a classic implementation of the popular game Tetris in Python using the Pygame library. The game features falling blocks of different shapes that the player can move and rotate to fit into rows at the bottom of the screen. When a row is filled, it disappears, and the player scores points. As the game progresses, the falling blocks increase in speed, providing a challenging and entertaining experience.

This repository includes the full source code for the PyTetris game, along with a README file containing instructions on how to run the game and play it. It is a fun project for developers looking to explore game development with Python and Pygame, as well as for those who want to relive the nostalgic moments of playing Tetris.

Features:

Classic Tetris gameplay
Keyboard controls for moving and rotating the blocks
Scoring system based on completed lines
